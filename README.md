# Stressed
This tool performs several transformations and compares multiple failure theories for a given stress tensor.

## Summary
- Calculates the principal stresses and stress invariants
- Calculates Max Shear stress per Tresca failure theory
- Calculates von Mises stress and compares two methods of determining sign for use with Signed von Mises criterion
- Plots Mohr's Circle for 2D or 3D stress states
